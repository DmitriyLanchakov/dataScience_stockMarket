acf2() function plots the ACF (auto-correlation function) and PACF (partial auto-correlation function) to find out what kind of model we wanted to use. Since we found that the data has seasonality (meaning that the mean is non-stationary) we decided to not use the AR (auto-regressive) model nor MA (moving average) model because these rely on the assumption that the data is stationary.

auto-regressive is ...

moving-average is ...

What we did instead was to run the auto.arima function, which is R's estimation of the best model for data using the AIC value.

ARIMA(1,1,2)(0,0,1)[12] with drift

this means 

ARIMA(p = 1, d = 1, q = 2, P = 0, D = 0, Q = 1, S = 12)

where
p = ,
q = ,
d = ,
P = ,
Q = ,
D = ,
S =
