STEP 1:
MODEL:
find the best model

	linear regression model
		backwards elimination
		confidence intervals
		BIC method (uses AIC)

	univariate time-series model with transformations

	panel or multi-variate time series model (VAR)
	
	predict with each model and compare results
	___
	

	we want high correlation across these models

	split - training / testing

		how do we split, and test

	correlation plot matrix

		pairs / scatterplot matrix

		correlation across variables?
STEP 2:
VISUALIZATION:
	d3 or ggplots

STEP 3:
WRITE UP:

		assumptions

			we don't a shit when data was released, we treat data as integers

			there is intrinsic error in the model

			weekly stationary for time-series

				we transform the data because of this

VAR - multivariate time series

		conclusions
